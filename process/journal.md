- Call with Stéphanie
- Slide Jump prototyping
- Realized that keeping jump, slide and forward pressed breaks everything... might need a big refactor tomorrow...

# 2024-03-13
- Unity prototyping
- Lore and level design brainstorming

# 2024-03-12
- Forgot my laptop charger at home (3h30 away...) so I looked at and gathered game design stuff and references on my phone

- OFF (medical issue)

# 2024-03-08
- Attempts at implementing sliding (je crois que ça marche enfin!)

# 2024-03-07
- Attempts at implementing sliding (back to adding forces)

# 2024-03-06
- Attempts at implementing sliding (testing setting velocity directly instead of adding forces)

# 2024-03-05
- Attempts at implementing sliding (irregular terrain still not working, trying other approaches)

# 2024-03-04
- Attempts at implementing sliding (works ~ok on flat slopes, not on irregular terrain, might have to try accumulating forces instead of setting velocity directly to make smoother movements)
