- Tried to add footprints on ground (but failed)
- Took some time to read about game feel
- Added tilting on movement and on slopes
- Enhanced dialogue visuals

# 2024-04-09
- Implemented meh working dialogues (might be ok for now)

# 2024-04-08
- Finished lever and started implementing dialogue system

# 2024-03-08
- Trying to implement interact with lever to activate bridge

# 2024-03-27
- Presentation day

# 2024-03-26
- Worked on action block (follow light in fog)

# 2024-03-25
- Prepared demo
- Documentation on LD
- Starting to work on action blocks (plateforming)

# 2024-03-22
- Finished boosting and jetpacking
- Prepared playground
- Read stuff on Unity terrains and UI

# 2024-03-21
- Worked on boosting and jetpacking

# 2024-03-19
- (Re)Added some animations
- Toyed with visuals to find a cool aesthetic (and took a break from movements...) 

# 2024-03-18
- Continued working on movements (move around, jump, slope handeling, slide, slide jump)

# 2024-03-15
- Started from scratch with a new way of handling movements

# 2024-03-14
- Call with Stéphanie
- Slide Jump prototyping
- Realized that keeping jump, slide and forward pressed breaks everything... might need a big refactor tomorrow...

# 2024-03-13
- Unity prototyping
- Lore and level design brainstorming

# 2024-03-12
- Forgot my laptop charger at home (3h30 away...) so I looked at and gathered game design stuff and references on my phone

# 2024-03-11
- OFF (medical issue)

# 2024-03-08
- Attempts at implementing sliding (je crois que ça marche enfin!)

# 2024-03-07
- Attempts at implementing sliding (back to adding forces)

# 2024-03-06
- Attempts at implementing sliding (testing setting velocity directly instead of adding forces)

# 2024-03-05
- Attempts at implementing sliding (irregular terrain still not working, trying other approaches)

# 2024-03-04
- Attempts at implementing sliding (works ~ok on flat slopes, not on irregular terrain, might have to try accumulating forces instead of setting velocity directly to make smoother movements) 

# 2024-03-01
- Finished tutorial
- Attempts at implementing sliding

# 2024-02-29
- Unity prototyping (essai d'une autre approche pour le mouvement)

# 2024-02-28
