## DEMO LEVEL (one open area)
### GOALS
- Introduce the player to the game's mechanics and story
- Create a level that is both visually appealing and fun to play
- Encourage free exploration while guiding the player
- Create a sense of freedom when exploring
- Create a sense of awe when discovering the ancient structure
- Make the player feel smart when unlocking the path to the next area

### ELEMENTS
Mechanics
- Sliding mechanic
- Jumping mechanic
- Boosting mechanic
- Energy mechanic

Points of interest
- Ancient structure
- Recharge station
- Closed path (bridge? door?)
- Other explorers (small camp? lost one?)

Natural structures
- Slopes
- Snowstorm
- Canyon
- Cave

### QUESTIONS
- What is interesting about those mechanics?

WHY ARE THOSE MECHANICS INTERESTING ?
- Sliding enables :
    - Player can gain speed on slope
- Jumping enables :
    - Player can reach higher platforms
- Boosting enables :
    - Player can gain speed on flat terrain
    - Player can gain launch themselves in the air
- Energy enables :
    - Player has a limited boost capacity and has to manage it
    - Player can recharge their energy
- Sliding + Jumping enables :
    - Plan can slide jump to use their slide momentum to make a longer jump
- Sliding + Boosting enables :
    - Player can slide boost to gain speed on flat terrain to make a longer slide
- Jumping + Boosting enables :
    - Player can use boost when jumping to gain air control

### GAMEPLAY BEATS 
(types of gameplay, phases, situations, key moments,...)
- (Platforming)


- Traversal from PoI to PoI
- Starting with limited movement understanding
- Getting to move around easily

### IDEAS
Obstacles : 
- Player has to slide then use jump and boost to reach an area
- Player has to find a way to recharge their energy on the way to an area

Structure : 
- The end of the level is locked behind a *switch* that has to be found
- The player can see its end goal from the start of the level
- The player can see the switch location when the path gets blocked

**SEQUENCE** (Player experience)
- Level starts with player in a snowstorm following a trail of lights
    - Movements and visibility are restrained

- ...

- Player sees the path is blocked by a *broken* bridge

- ...

- Level ends with player leaving to next area, seeing a big ancient structure in the distance
